# DMS 290 Assignment 7

This website is based on Brian Jesse Kimani's [assignment 2](https://jbkimani.digitalscholar.rochester.edu/assignment02/).

## Font Choices
I chose 'Satisfy' to use as the primary typeface and 'Lato' as the secondary. I landed on this pairing because I felt like the
style of the website felt more old-fashioned given the color scheme and the background. Because of this, I wanted to
choose a primary font that was serifed and had a look of old-fashioned cursive writing. After browsing Google
fonts I found the font 'Satisfy' which matched what I was looking for. Then I used Google Font's pairing engine to
find a secondary font. They offer several options, but I felt like 'Lato' had the least rounding, and thus
fit the primary font best. All of the fonts they recommended were sans-serif which wasn't ideal, but I felt that
'Lato' matched the theme of the page the best.

## CSS Changes
The first change I made was to the contrast of heading fonts. There seemed to be a lack of contrast between the font color and
background color of headings, as both were quite dark. I ensured that the font was as dark as possible and also lightened
the background a bit.

The next changes I made were all to improve what the Smashing Magazine article describes as "scannable text". I changed the font size and weight
of the headers, including the main title. I wanted to draw more attention to them, as they are some of the key focus points for the user.
I also changed the line height and letter spacing of the body font used for the body. I felt that the paragraph text was too dense,
and referring to the Smashing Magazine article, expanding this text a small amount made it more readable and scannable.

Finally, I also adjusted the navigation element's font size and color. Because it is an important part of the website,
I wanted to draw more attention to it, and ensure that there was enough contrast to be readable, even in the hover state.

# DMS 290 Assignment 7

This website is based off of Brian Jesse Kimani's [assignment 2](https://jbkimani.digitalscholar.rochester.edu/assignment02/).

## Font Choices
I chose 'Satisfy' to use as the primary typeface and 'Lato' as the secondary. I landed on this pairing because I felt like the
style of the website felt more old-fashioned given the color scheme and the background. Because of this, I wanted to
choose a primary font that was serifed, and had a look of old-fashnioned cursive writing. After browsing Google
fonts I found a the font 'Satisfy' which matched what I was looking for. Then I used Google Font's pairing engine to
find a secondary font. They offer a number of options, but I felt like 'Lato' had the least rounding, and thus
fit the primary font best. All of the fonts they recommended were sans-serif which wasn't ideal, but I felt that
'Lato' matched the theme of the page the best.

# DMS 290 Assignment 7
> Duncan Grubbs, DMS 290, 3/24/21

This website is based on Brian Jesse Kimani's [assignment 2](https://jbkimani.digitalscholar.rochester.edu/assignment02/).

The previous font was 'Verdana', but there were fallback fonts specified (Geneva and Tahoma).

## Font Choices
I chose 'Satisfy' to use as the primary typeface and 'Lato' as the secondary. I landed on this pairing because I felt like the
style of the website was more old-fashioned given the color scheme and the background. Because of this, I wanted to
choose a primary font that was serifed and had a look of old-fashioned cursive writing. After browsing Google
fonts I found the font 'Satisfy' which matched what I was looking for. Then I used Google Font's pairing engine to
find a secondary font. They offer several options, but I felt like 'Lato' had the least rounding, and thus
matched with the primary font best. All of the fonts they recommended were sans-serif which wasn't ideal, but I felt that
'Lato' still matched the theme of the page well.

## Planned Improvements
I think that the biggest areas of improvement for this website's readability and legibility are
1. Paragraph Text is too densely spaced, and thus not easily scannable
2. Header text is not larger enough and does not provide enough contrast to stand out
3. Navigation text is small and does not grab the user's attention

To solve these problems, I plan to make header's larger and ensuring proper contrast between the text and the background.
Spacing out paragraph text appropriately, both with letter spacing and line-height, and enlarging navigation font size.

## CSS Changes
The first change I made was to the contrast of heading fonts. There seemed to be a lack of contrast between the font color and
background color of headings, as both were quite dark. I ensured that the font was as dark as possible and also lightened
the background a bit.

The next changes I made were all to improve what the Smashing Magazine article describes as "scannable text". I changed the font size and weight
of the headers, including the main title. I wanted to draw more attention to them, as they are some of the key focus points for the user.
I also changed the line height and letter spacing of the body font used for the body. I felt that the paragraph text was too dense,
and referring to the Smashing Magazine article, expanding this text a small amount made it more readable and scannable.

Finally, I also adjusted the navigation element's font size and color. Because it is an important part of the website,
I wanted to draw more attention to it, and ensure that there was enough contrast to be readable, even in the hover state.
